# Meal-App Project

Project Description
This project is a simple meal app created using only vanilla JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks for JavaScript are allowed; however, you can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap for styling.

The main features of the meal app include:

Home Page
Search any meal from the API and display search results on the frontend.
Search results update dynamically as the user types (similar to Google's search suggestions).
Each search result has a favorite button; clicking it adds the meal to "My Favourite Meals" list.
Clicking on any search result opens a new page with more information about that meal (Meal Detail Page).

Meal Detail Page
Displays detailed information about the meal, including name, photo, instructions, and other relevant details.

My Favourite Meals Page
Displays a list of all favorite meals.
The list is persistent, maintaining the same number of meals even after closing or refreshing the browser.
Each meal in the list has a "Remove from Favourites" button to remove it from the list.
